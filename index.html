.left-column[
  ## HTTP Protocol
  ### What is it?
]
.right-column[
  Short for .strong[.marked[H]ypertext .marked[T]ransfer .m[P]rotocol.]

layout: false
.left-column[
  ## HTTP Protocol
  ### What is it?
  ### How it works?
]
.right-column[
  - All information travels in plain text with this protocol.

  .m[request] example:

  ```remark
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: tec.mx
  User-Agent: curl 9.0.0
  ```
  .m[response] of that:

  ```remark

]
.right-column[
### Request
```remark
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tec.mx
User-Agent: curl 9.0.0
```

#### Firs line contains three different things
  - .pre[GET] refers to HTTP method
  - .pre[/] is the path requested
  - .pre[HTTP/1.1] Protoco version, 1.1 in this case.

#### All remaining lines are headers
  - .pre[Host:] url we want to browse
  - .pre[User-Agent:] Where we're requesting from.

  <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
  <p>The document has moved <a href="https://tec.mx/">here</a>.</p>
</body>
